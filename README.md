# spicy

An open-source version of Nintendo64 sdk's mild.exe. Assembles segments into an
n64-compatible rom. This binary should eventually be a drop in, multiplatform
replacement for mild.exe.

## Usage
Get the binary:

```shell
go get github.com/trhodeos/spicy
```

TODO: figure out what it takes to distribute a go binary..
